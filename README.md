# Movies App Flutter
A Flutter application to demonstrate to use of flutter's [Chopper Package](https://pub.dev/packages/chopper) for manage the HTTP Network calls and [Provider Package](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) for state management. I am using TMDB API for fetch the Movies List and TV shows Categories or Genres also fetching from the same.
In order to run the application create take a fork of code and create a [API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/) on TMDB for you and put in constant.dart file.

## Features
#### 1. Fetching Listing for Trending Movies, Upcoming Movies, Trending TV Shows & Trending Celebrity Persons, by using the Chopper Library for Flutter.
#### 2. I am using Navigator 2.0 for Naigation between Screens.
#### 3. For state management in the wide app I am using Provider package.
